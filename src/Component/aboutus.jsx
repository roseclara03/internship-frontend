            Hello! My name is Rose Clara Joshi, and I am a 4th-year Computer Science student. This website is a trial project for my internship, where I learned and applied the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about technology and constantly seeking to improve my skills and knowledge in the field of computer science. This internship has provided me with valuable experience in full-stack development, and I am excited to continue growing and contributing to innovative projects.
